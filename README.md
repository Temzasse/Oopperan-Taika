# Oopperan Taika (User Interface Construction course)

A mobile / tablet web application for the Finnish National Opera - A school project about user interface construction.

The idea is to tell about the different aspects of the Finnish National Opera: famous operas, behind-the-scenes etc. We created 4 different cartoonlike characters to make the service more compelling to children.
